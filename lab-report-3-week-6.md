# Week 6 Lab Report by Daniel Lee

## Streaming ssh Configuration

### **.ssh config file**

![.ssh config](images/sshfile.PNG)

This config file was edited using notepad. I copied the lines from the week 5 lab.

###  **.ssh login**

![.ssh login command](images/sshlogin.PNG)

I used command prompt to login to the ieng6 server. I used the ieng6 identity I created in the config.

### **SCP command**

I used scp to copy a txt file called move_file.txt to the ieng6 server. I used the ieng6 identity saved on my computer to make using the scp command easier. It shows up in my main directory when I connect to the server.
